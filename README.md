# Code-Buddies
This is my Andela Ruby Project

## Pair Programming Application
This is a web based application 

It allows
  1. new users to signup / login
  2. logged in users create new coding sessions
  3. creators of the sessions can delete their sessions
  4. by sharing the code session URL another user can join the session
  5. Within each session there is a chat room
  6. Everything is real time

## Web Interface
To run this locally you just have to ` node js ` installed
and other dependences found in the `package.json` file
